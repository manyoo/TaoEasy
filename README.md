TaoEasy
=======

A prototype web app written in Haskell and Snap to scrap and show different kind of deals from taobao.com

Notes:
1, This app is just a prototype, and it never goes online.
2, It has some common features with my another project: jinglingtao.com, which is a production web server written in Haskell/Snap and still serving my iOS app.
3, This app is using MongoDB instead of MySQL, which is used on jinglingtao.com
4, It's using the wonderful TagSoup package to scrap data from webpages.
5, The scraping code may not work now as the pages should have changed a lot.
